# DNN_Data-Preprocessing
This repository contains data extraction and cleaning steps to develop a deep neural network model later.
The datasets used are from CDC's website and are available in SAS formats. Python is used for data extraction, cleaning, and basic statistical analysis. We aim to develop a deep neural network model for a binary classification problem later in our study.
